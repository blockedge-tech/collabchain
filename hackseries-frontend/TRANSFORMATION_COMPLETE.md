## 📝 CSS Notes

### Expected Warnings (Safe to Ignore)
```
Unknown at rule @apply
```

These are **normal Tailwind CSS warnings**. The `@apply` directive is a Tailwind feature that standard CSS validators don't recognize. Your app will work perfectly—these are just informational warnings.

- Whitespace creates focus

### 3. **Consistent Branding**
