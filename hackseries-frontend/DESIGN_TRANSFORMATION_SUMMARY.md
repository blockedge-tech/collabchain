## 🎨 CSS Notes

### Lint Warnings (Expected & Safe)
The CSS shows warnings about `@apply` directives:
```
Unknown at rule @apply
```

**These are expected** - Tailwind CSS uses `@apply` which standard CSS validators don't recognize. These warnings don't affect functionality and can be safely ignored.

### Custom Animations
All animations are hardware-accelerated using:
- `transform-gpu` class
- `transform` properties (not `top/left`)
- `will-change` when needed

---

## 💡 Design Philosophy

### 1. **Approachable Not Corporate**
- Sounds like a helpful friend
- No marketing jargon
- Real examples people understand

### 2. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Important things are bigger
- Color draws attention
- Whitespace creates focus

### 3. **Consistent Branding**
- Purple/pink everywhere
- Same button styles
- Unified gradients
- Matching shadows

### 4. **Delightful Interactions**
- Everything responds to hover
- Smooth transitions
- Satisfying feedback
- 3D depth
