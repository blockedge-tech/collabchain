# CollabChain: Blockchain-Based Credential Verification Platform

## Abstract

CollabChain is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Algorand blockchain that provides an immutable, transparent, and tamper-resistant mechanism for issuing and verifying digital credentials. The platform addresses the long-standing issue of forged certificates, unverifiable achievements, and the inefficiency of manual background verification by combining smart contracts, IPFS storage, and cryptographic proofs. Through SoulBound Tokens (SBTs), CollabChain ensures that each credential is permanently linked to the recipient's wallet, creating a verifiable and auditable record of academic or professional achievements.

## 1. Introduction

Credential fraud has become a critical concern for employers, universities, and certification authorities. Traditional verification methods rely on centralized databases, third-party validation services, or manually cross-referenced PDFs—all of which are vulnerable to forgery, alteration, or loss of authenticity over time.

CollabChain proposes a blockchain-based model that automates credential issuance and verification through smart contracts and decentralized storage. The system ensures that every credential is issued by a verified institution, stored in an immutable form, and verifiable in real time by any third party.

## 2. System Architecture

The platform architecture follows a layered model to ensure modularity, scalability, and security.

| Layer | Technology Stack | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend (Web3 DApp)** | React.js, Expressjs,Mongodb if required | Provides the user interface for students, issuers, and verifiers. Enables wallet connectivity, credential upload, and verification functionalities. |
| **Wallet Integration** | Pera Wallet SDK | Facilitates user authentication, digital signatures, and blockchain interaction through Algorand-compatible wallets. |
| **Blockchain Network** | Algorand Testnet/Mainnet | Serves as the decentralized ledger to store credential metadata and ensure immutability through transaction records. |
| **Smart Contracts** | PyTeal (Python TEAL) or Reach | Implements credential minting, issuer verification, and access control logic. Each credential is minted as a non-transferable SoulBound Token (SBT). |
| **Backend / API Layer (Optional)** | Node.js with Express | Provides middleware services for file handling, IPFS uploads, and issuer verification. Can be used for analytics or off-chain logic. |
| **Off-chain Storage** | IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) / Pinata | Used for storing credential documents, certificates, and research metadata. Only the IPFS hash is stored on-chain to maintain data integrity. |
| **Verification & AI Layer (Optional)** | Python APIs and ML models | Performs document originality and plagiarism analysis for academic or research-related credentials. |
| **Testing & Deployment** | Algokit, AlgoNode, PureStake API | Tooling and APIs for deploying and testing smart contracts in Algorand's testnet or mainnet environments. |

## 3. Workflow: Real-World Implementation

### 3.1 Credential Issuance

**Actors:**

- **Issuer (Organization):** A verified institution or company registered on CollabChain.
- **Recipient (Student/Employee):** A user with a verified Algorand wallet address.

**Process:**

1. The issuer logs into the CollabChain DApp using its verified wallet credentials.
2. The issuer uploads the following details:
    - Recipient wallet address
    - Credential details (title, description, duration)
    - Certificate document (PDF or image)
3. The DApp:
    - Uploads the certificate document to IPFS and retrieves a unique hash.
    - Sends the metadata and IPFS hash to the smart contract on Algorand.
    - Executes a transaction to mint a SoulBound NFT bound to the recipient's wallet.

**Example On-chain Metadata:**

```json
{
  "issuer": "TechNova Labs",
  "student": "0xA4D5...",
  "title": "Blockchain Internship",
  "duration": "June 2025 - August 2025",
  "ipfs_link": "ipfs://QmA1b2C3...",
  "issue_date": "2025-08-10",
  "verified": true
}

```

The NFT is non-transferable and acts as a verifiable digital credential that permanently resides in the recipient's wallet.

---

### 3.2 Credential Sharing

Recipients can share their credentials via:

- A **public CollabChain profile link** (e.g., `collabchain.app/verify/0xA4D5.../NFT12345`)
- A **QR code** linked directly to the NFT's metadata.

This allows recruiters, universities, or third parties to instantly access verified credentials without intermediaries.

---

### 3.3 Credential Verification

When a verifier accesses the shared credential:

1. The CollabChain DApp queries the Algorand blockchain through the AlgoNode or PureStake API.
2. The smart contract retrieves the metadata associated with the NFT.
3. The verification logic ensures:
    - The issuer's wallet address is whitelisted and verified.
    - The credential hash matches the original file stored in IPFS.
    - The NFT ownership is retained by the claimed recipient.
    - The NFT has not been modified, transferred, or revoked.

Upon validation, the verifier receives a confirmation with the credential's details, timestamp, and on-chain hash.

---

### 3.4 Fraud Prevention and Integrity Checks

If a fraudulent certificate (e.g., manipulated PDF) is submitted for verification:

- The platform computes the file hash locally.
- It compares the computed hash with the IPFS hash recorded on-chain.
- Any mismatch immediately results in an "Invalid or Unverified Credential" alert.

**Integrity Mechanisms:**

- IPFS guarantees content immutability.
- Smart contracts enforce ownership and non-transferability.
- Issuer whitelist ensures only verified entities can issue credentials.
- On-chain timestamps provide an auditable history of issuance.

## 4. Cybersecurity Threats and Mitigation Strategies

| Threat Type | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Credential Forgery** | Creation of fake or modified certificates | IPFS hashing ensures authenticity; any altered document produces a different hash and fails verification. |
| **Unauthorized Issuance** | Unverified entities attempting to issue credentials | Only whitelisted issuers with verified wallets can execute credential minting transactions. |
| **Phishing and Wallet Spoofing** | Users tricked into connecting to fake DApps or wallets | CollabChain enforces HTTPS, domain verification, and secure wallet signature requests. |
| **Metadata Tampering** | Attempts to modify stored credential data | Metadata is written immutably on Algorand; all transactions are cryptographically signed. |
| **Data Privacy Risks** | Exposure of sensitive user information | Only cryptographic hashes and metadata are stored on-chain; files remain decentralized on IPFS without personal identifiers. |
